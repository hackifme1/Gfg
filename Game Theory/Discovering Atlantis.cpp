/* Problem Statement :

Jack and Jelly are on the ship en route to discover Atlantis. The distance between their starting point and the city of Atlantis is N kilometers. They take turns manning the 
ship and each of them can steer the ship for 1, 2 or 4 kilometers in one turn. This should never exceed the remaining distance.
If Jelly starts as the captain-incharge of the ship, find who will be incharge of the ship when they reach Atlantis.


Example 1:

Input: N = 2
Output: JELLY

Explaination: Jelly can cover 2 Km 
in his first turn itself.

Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: JACK

Explaination: On his first turn Jelly can 
cover either 1 or 2km. In either case, Jack 
will cover the remaining distance in his turn.
 

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function captain() which takes the N as input parameter and returns a string ("JACK" or "JELLY")
denoting the name of the final captain.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 
Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^7
